## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- javascript
- mobile first
- localstorage
- [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) - icons



### What I learned


```html
<!--I can create modals more easily-->
<dialog class="modal-alert hidden">...
  ```
```css
/*can i make the scroll appear*/
.question{
  overflow:auto;
}
```
```js
//Can I remove an event listener
save_btn.removeEventListener("click", handleClick)
```

### Continued development

```
Mobile first, clean code, refactoring, localstorage.
```


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - used for icons and alerts.


### How to run the code? 

Cloning/downloading the project

Enter the command```git clone https://github.com/alexandreSouza31/control-of-expenses``` in the terminal, or if you prefer, download it by clicking on the green button called "Code" in this project's repository, and then, "Download zip.

run index.html

#### Deploy

If you want to see the application running without having to download it, go to
- [Vercel](https://control-of-expenses.vercel.app/) - Website used to host the application.


If you get a Json error due to local storage, comment out lines 26-37 of script.js and add below line 37: 

let data_transactions =[
        { id: 1, description: "salário", amount: 3000, date: "01-11-2022" },
        { id: 3, description: "lanche", amount: -70, date: "10-04-2023" },
    ]

Note that this is a local storage bug with Chrome, so by doing this your app will not work on local storage.
